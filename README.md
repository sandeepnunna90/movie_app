# Create a Movie App

Create a website for you and all your friends to rate movies you all have seen, with the ability to leave feedback.

**Requirements:**
- Your website should be in the Framework that best displays your current development skills.
- Your example must have a running link, hosted by a platform such as Heroku or Digital Ocean.
- Your code must be on GitHub.
- You should have an administrative interface to add in new movies.
- The movies should have a picture field, to upload a DVD cover or movie poster cover.
- The movie should have a description of the movie; a synopsis.
- You must allow users to log in to vote and leave feedback on movies.
- Your homepage should consist of a searchable list of the movies, including an average review
score from users.
- Users should not be able to review the same movie twice.
- Reviews should consist of a score and a comment.
- Please put some seed/fake data in place, so when we view it, we see reviews and movies.
- Include user credentials for an admin user so we can review the administrative functionality.
- Put your best foot forward; make sure the front-end looks as nice as possible.
- Your search should support partial searches; “Man” in the search would bring up “Batman Begins” if that movie was in your database.
- A user should be able to edit their existing review.
- An average review score should be shown. Show the average of all the movie’s scores as the
average score.
